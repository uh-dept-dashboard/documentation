The [School of Pacific and Asian Studies (SPAS) Three Year Progress Report](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/ovcaa/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/spas_three_year_progress_report.pdf) provides the following opportunities for a dashboard:

## On attractiveness of the degree program to professionals

The report states:

> Many of the courses will be offered in the evenings or weekends or onlineâ€”all in a concerted effort to make this new degree attractive to the professional student clientele, who work during normal weekday hours.

By adding a course evaluation question (such as "As a professional student, I found this course attractive and compatible with my work life") and tracking the response to it, progress toward meeting this goal can be assessed in a dashboard.

## On the importance of SSH and numbers of majors

The report states:

> The issue of enrollment (numbers of majors and SSH) remains the most challenging area for SPAS and was one of the determining factors in including SPAS in the reorganization merging SPAS into a larger college. The good news has been the increase this year in overall SSH for SPAS and marked increases in declared majors at both the undergraduate and graduate degree programs in ASP, and steady levels with modest fluctuations for enrollments in CPIS.

A dashboard can track both SSH and enrollment.

## On the importance of funding

The report states:

> Funding from our tuition-generated scholarship allotment, combined with strategic awarding of endowment- generated scholarships plays an important role in attracting students. FLAS awards and GAships for graduate students have been key to maintaining graduate students in both ASP and CPIS.

A dashboard can help monitor funding levels for students to ensure they maintain appropriate levels.
