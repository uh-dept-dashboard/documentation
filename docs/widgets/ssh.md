## Motivation

The Student Semester Hours (SSH) widget indicates the size of the student body engaging with the academic unit in a given academic year. Changes in SSH have the potential to be useful for interpreting changes in the "health" and/or "performance" of an academic unit.

## Rollup

The total number of SSH for the academic unit in a given academic year.

## Baseline

The total number of SSH per faculty FTE in a given academic year.
