## Motivation

An academic unit's ranking can be important for attracting undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.  There are a variety of mechanisms for assessing reputation and/or ranking.  The much maligned US News and World Report rankings are nevertheless the go-to guide for parents and high school students, and so a unit's ranking there will have a significant impact on whether students decide to attend UH or go to a mainland school.

## Rollup

This widget can provide a visualization of the academic unit's ranking for a given academic year from one or more sources. Forbes has an article from September 2020: [Comparing The Major College Ranking Systems: How Methodology Matters](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2020/09/20/comparing-the-college-ranking-systemshere-are-the-major-differences/#315d8f565c12), which can help an academic unit decide which ranking is most useful to them.

Some disciplines may have their own ranking site. For example, in computer science, [csrankings.org](http://csrankings.org/) provides more fine-grained rankings: you can see rankings for different subdisciplines (AI, Databases, Theory, etc.)

## Drilldown

I am not aware of a useful drilldown for this measure.

## Baseline

In many cases, the absolute value of a ranking is difficult to interpret without reference to the rankings of peer departments. Therefore, when the department dashboard is configured with a set of peer institution departments, this widget can show how this department's ranking compares to its peers.
