## Motivation

Faculty FTE provides a key measure of the "resources" available to the academic unit for teaching, research, and service. The external reviews indicated that many academic units are concerned with maintaining their levels of faculty FTE, and that issues with respect to other measures are related to changes in this key measure.

For STEM disciplines in particular, maintaining (or achieving) demographic diversity in faculty FTE is an important issue.

## Rollup

The total number of faculty FTE for a given academic year.

## Drilldown: by demographic

A breakdown of faculty FTE by women and/or underrepresented groups.

## Baseline

For some academic units, it can be useful to track the number of faculty FTE for peer institutions.
