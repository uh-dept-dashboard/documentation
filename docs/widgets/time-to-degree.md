title: Time to Degree

## Motivation

All undergraduate degree programs at the University of Hawaii are designed to be completed in eight semesters. Graduate programs can vary, but there is a cap of seven years. This measure provides an indication of the "efficiency" of the program from a student perspective.

Time To Degree (TTD) is computed for a given academic year by determining the entry semester for each student graduating in that academic year. The entry semester is typically determined by finding the semester in which the student first took an introductory class in the degree program.

## Rollup

A useful way to visualize Time to Degree for a single academic year is with a box and whiskers plot, which provides information about both central tendency and variability.

## Drilldown: by demographic

A drilldown can provide TTD values broken out by women and/or underrepresented groups to see if there appear to be significant differences.

## Baseline

When available, national measures or peer institution measures of time-to-degree for the given academic unit can provide a meaningful point of comparison.
