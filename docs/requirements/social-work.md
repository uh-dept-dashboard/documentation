The School of Social Work's [2020 One Year Progress Report](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/ovcaa/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SW-One-Year-Report-PhD-in-Social-Welfare-SWEL_051520.pdf) provides the following ideas for a department dashboard:

## On extramural funding

From the one year progress report:

> Recommendation: "Seek increased support for extramural grant preparation from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at UHM."  In response: "The School continues to provide support for faculty members to secure extramural funding and build their research portfolios as success in these areas would naturally benefit the PhD students and program. The current and next several years will yield one of the highest levels of extramural funding support for social work in its 80+ year history."

(Editor's note: kudos to the School of Social Work for its success in obtaining extramural funding!)  The dashboard can provide several forms of evidence to assess the success of efforts to "support extramural grant preparation", including:

  * The number of extramural grant proposals submitted per year, and awarded per year.
  * The total amount of extramural funding in all proposals submitted per year, and the total amount awarded.
  * The average number of grant proposals per faculty member, and their distribution.

## On student retention

From the one year progress report:

> Recommendation: "Increase and expand efforts for student recruitment and retention". In response: "The PhD in SWEL program received an increased number of applications, and will welcome a cohort of five students in Fall 2020, which is the largest cohort since Fall 2012.", and "The program emphasized mentoring by 1) engaging increased number of graduate faculty in teaching PhD courses, mentoring one-on-one independent research, teaching and research practica"

Useful dashboard widgets could include:

  * The number of Ph.D. applicants per year, and the number accepted.
  * Number of faculty teaching Ph.D. courses
  * Number of faculty mentoring independent research.
  * Number of faculty leading teaching and research practica.
  * Percentage of Ph.D. students engaged in at least one mentoring program.
