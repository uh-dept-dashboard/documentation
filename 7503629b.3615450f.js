This analysis can be extremely useful for determining a baseline for retention (i.e. there are 40% women in the 100-level classes, but only 15% women graduates).  Over the course of several semesters, the department can start to understand whether retention is relatively constant, its variability, whether it is trending up or down, and where to focus efforts.  For example, if there are 40% women in the 100-level classes, but only 15% women from then on, then it\'s probably useful to focus on the 100-level classes. On the other hand, if there\'s only 15% women in the 100-level classes, and all 15% graduate, then the problem is not the degree program, it\'s "expanding the pipeline".'),Object(i.b)("p",null,'What\'s important to note is that while the published analysis in this example contains only aggregate percentages and no student PII, producing the analysis requires PII.  This is because you need to count the number of unique students at each course level, not just the total number of students enrolled in each class.  Put another way, if a single student takes three 300-level courses, that student should only count once in the calculation of retention for that grade level.
