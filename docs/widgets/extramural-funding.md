title: Extramural Funding
---

## Motivation

The external reviews indicate that the level of extramural funding is an important measure for most academic units.  However, some units focus exclusively on the amount of extramural funding awarded, while others also want to encourage increased proposal submission, whether they are ultimately funded or not.

## Rollup

The total number of dollars awarded to the academic unit per academic year. For multi-year awards, the dollar amount can be spread out.

If desired by the academic unit, the measure could also track the total number of dollars in submitted proposals per academic year.

## Drilldown: by faculty

The total amount can be broken down by the responsible faculty member.

## Baseline

Extramural funding per faculty FTE provides a useful baseline number that can be helpful for comparing this measure to peer institutions.
