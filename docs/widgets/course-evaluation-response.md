title: Course Evaluation Response
---

## Motivation

Several units indicate specific goals for their courses that could be assessed via department-wide course evaluation questions, such as:

  * "As a professional student, I found this course attractive and compatible with my work life" (SPAS)
  * "This course provided opportunities for me to improve my software development skills" (ICS)
  * "This course provided me with useful interdisciplinary experiences." (Nursing)

## Rollup

For each question of interest, the average of all responses across all courses.  This provides a "global" indicator of the department's progress toward the goal of interest over time, at least as perceived by students.

An alternative representation could be a box and whisker chart.

## Drilldown: By course

A breakdown by course.

Since responses are anonymous, we cannot break down by demographic.

## Drilldown: by faculty member

A breakdown of responses, aggregated across all of the course taught by a specific faculty member in a given academic year.

## Baseline

No known baselines.
