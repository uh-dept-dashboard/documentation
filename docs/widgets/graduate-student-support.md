title: Graduate Student Support
---

## Motivation

The health of a graduate degree program, and its ability to attract new students, depends upon the ability to offer financial support in the form of teaching assistantships and graduate assistantships. Ideally, 100% of students in a graduate program are provided support.

## Rollup

The total number of graduate students receiving TAs and RAs for a given semester, as well as the number of graduate students not receiving any support, from which a percentage can be provided.

## Drilldown: by demographic

A breakout by demographic such as women and underrepresented groups can provide information on whether there are demographic variances.

## Baseline

Data from peer institutions on the percentage of graduate students with support can provide useful context.
