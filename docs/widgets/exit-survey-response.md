title: Exit Survey Response

## Motivation

Administering an exit survey to students close to their graduation date can provide very useful outcome data on the degree program from the student's perspective, as well as a perspective on the immediate future of the student's professional career.  Many schools already perform exit surveys. Here are some examples:

  * [Western Washington University Undergraduate Exit Survey](https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1676&context=surveyresearch_docs)
  * [Framington State University Undergraduate Student Exit Survey](https://www.framingham.edu/Assets/uploads/about-fsu/institutional-effectiveness/_documents/overall-undergraduate-student-exit-survey.pdf)
  * [Stanislaus State Graduate School Exit Survey](https://www.csustan.edu/iea/survey-data/graduate-school-exit-survey)
  * [Indiana University PhD Student Exit Survey](https://graduate.indiana.edu/doc/shared/iuexitsurvey.pdf)
  * [University of Texas School of Public Health Exit Survey](https://sph.uth.edu/content/uploads/2010/05/FINAL-2010-2011-Student-Exit-Survey-09-20-12.pdf)
  * [University of Northern Colorado Graduate Student Exit Survey](https://www.unco.edu/graduate-school/pdf/student-surveys/Exit-Summary-2012-2013.pdf)
  * [University of Washington Graduate School Exit Survey](http://www.washington.edu/reports/account/appendixm.html)

Here is a particularly interesting exit survey question from Western Washington University:

Note that the UHM ICS Department has recently signed up to participate in the [CRA Data Buddies Project](https://cra.org/cerp/data-buddies/). This project will hopefully yield useful data that can supplement exit survey data.

## Rollup

Assuming the questions are on a five point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, then the rollup is the average value of responses to a single question.

Different visualizations can be used for categorical responses.

## Drilldown: by demographic

Breakdowns by gender and/or member of underrepresented group.

## Drilldown: by degree program

Breakdown by specific degree program.

## Baseline

Public data sources such as the links above can be used to developed baselines if desired.
