## Motivation

All academic units view scholarly publications as an important measure of research productivity. Some units also focus on the publication venue as an important feature.

## Rollup

The total number of scholarly publications per academic year.

## Drilldown: by venue

The academic unit can establish classifications such as "Tier 1" and "Tier 2" journals or other ways to specify the quality of a publication.

## Drilldown: by impact

The impact of a publication can be measured by the number of citations, the h-index, the number of downloads, etc. It is important to note that impact measures will delay the actual publication by a significant number of years.

## Drilldown: by Faculty member

A breakdown of publications on a per-faculty member basis.

## Baseline

The number of publications per faculty FTE can be useful if comparison with other peer institutions is desired.
