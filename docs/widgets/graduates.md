title: Graduates

## Motivation

A key measure of "health" for many academic units is the number of graduates for an academic year. Low or falling numbers of graduates indicate either a decrease in student interest in the program, or perhaps insufficient faculty resources to deliver the program despite student demand.

## Rollup

The total number of graduates over all degree programs for the academic unit in an academic year.

## Drilldown: by degree program

A breakdown of graduates by degree program.

## Drilldown: by demographic

A breakdown of graduates showing the percentage who are women and/or members of underrepresented groups

## Drilldown: by degree level

A breakdown of graduates by degree level: B.A., B.S., M.S., Ph.D.

## Baseline

The number of graduates per AY can be normalized by the number of faculty FTE.  This baseline can be extended through comparison to peer academic units. For example, the external review for ICS contained the following comment:

>  * The number of Bachelors degrees granted annually per tenure-track faculty member in ICS (including the BS in CS and the BA in ICS) is 72% of the median of these other programs.
>  * Annual Masters degrees granted per tenure-track faculty member (including the MS in CS but not the MLISc) are only 1/3 of the median.
>  * Annual PhD degrees granted per tenure-track faculty member (including the PhD in CS and an appropriate proportion of the PhD in C&IS) also are roughly 1/3 of the median.

> To do these comparisons, the external review committee "compared the data we were provided for ICS with the data reported in the Computing Research Associationâ€™s 2018 Taulbee Survey for 29 Computer Science programs at public universities with 15-25 faculty."
