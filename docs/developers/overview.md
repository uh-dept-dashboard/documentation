Hey there!  If you are reading this page, you are probably a new Dashboard developer.  Thanks for joining the team!  We hope you enjoy your time working with us.

There are two fairly independent components to this project:

  1. The Dashboard itself, which is a static website written in Javascript and React,
  2. A set of scripts for querying various data repositories and generating data files in a format appropriate for the dashboard.

You can work on one or the other or both.

The first thing you probably want to do as a new developer is to read through this entire site to get a sense for the project and the state of documentation.  As you read, you will (hopefully) have questions.

For communication, we have set up a mailing list at [uh-dept-dashboard@lists.hawaii.edu](mailto:uh-dept-dashboard@lists.hawaii.edu).   We want to know what is confusing or unclear in our documentation so we can fix it. As a new developer, you are best suited to let us know when we didn't write clearly.

To document problems and opportunities, you will normally create [GitHub Issues for uh-dept-dashboard-template](https://github.com/uh-dept-dashboard/uh-dept-dashboard-template/issues).

We manage the tasks associated with this project using a [GitHub Project board for uh-dept-dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/uh-dept-dashboard/projects/1).

Good luck and have fun!
