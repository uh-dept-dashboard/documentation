## Motivation

Undergraduate participation in faculty research can have a strongly positive impact on a student's degree experience and their future professional career opportunities.

For more information on the benefits and barriers to undergraduate participation in faculty research, please see the [Computing Research Association 2020 Report](https://cra.org/crn/2020/11/cra-e-releases-report-on-best-practices-for-scaling-undergraduate-cs-research-opportunities/).

The [UHM Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/) provides UHM-specific resources.
