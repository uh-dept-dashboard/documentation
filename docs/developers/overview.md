Hey there!  If you are reading this page, you are probably a new InternAloha developer.  Thanks for joining the team!  We hope you enjoy your time working with us.

The first thing to do as a new developer is to read through this entire site: the Overview Chapter, User Guide Chapter, Developer Guide Chapter and About Us Chapter. You want to get a sense for the entire project.  As you read, you will (hopefully) have questions. Post your questions to the #internaloha-chat channel on the RadGrad Discord server.  We want to know what is confusing or unclear in our documentation so we can fix it. As a new developer, you are best suited to let us know when we didn't write clearly.

The second thing to do is to become familiar with the InternAloha tech stack, which is documented in the next section, [Tech Stack](./tech-stack). If you've had ICS 314, Software Engineering, then most of this tech stack should be at least a little familiar to you.  If not, then depending on your background, you may have a few weeks of self-study before you are ready for actual InternAloha development. That's OK!  Please don't cut corners and, for example, use your preferred editor rather than IntelliJ IDEA.  We all understand that this is tremendously enticing, but it will only work against you in the end. We would rather have you be a little slower at the start while you are learning our tech stack, then to try to rush into things, because we've learned through experience that if we all use the same tools, we can help each other better, and we can make the tools work better than if we all go our own way. Once again, we expect you'll have questions as you work with our tech stack. Don't worry!  Just post your questions to the #internaloha-chat channel on the RadGrad discord server, and we'll help you out.

The third thing to do is to download and install InternAloha locally. As part of that, you will want to run the system. You also need to learn how to run the tests. If you run into problems, just post a question to the #internaloha-chat channel.

After this, you'll be ready to dip your toes into actual development.  We will hopefully have a set of open issues with the label "Good First Issue" that we've preselected as being appropriate for newbies.

Good luck and have fun!
